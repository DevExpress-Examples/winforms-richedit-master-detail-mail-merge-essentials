# Master-Detail Mail Merge essential - The simplest implementation


<p>This example illustrates how to create the simplest Master-Detail report by combining the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument9330"><u>Mail Merge</u></a> feature with the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument9721"><u>DOCVARIABLE</u></a>, <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraRichEditRichEditControl_CalculateDocumentVariabletopic"><u>RichEditControl.CalculateDocumentVariable</u></a> and <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressXtraRichEditRichEditDocumentServertopic"><u>RichEditDocumentServer Class</u></a> functionality. Three <strong>RichEditControl</strong> instances are used in this example. The first and the second controls contain master (Category) and detail (Product) templates correspondingly. The third control is used to display the resultant report.</p><p>The actual report generation implementation is pretty simple. When you press the "Create Report" button, master data rows from the first control are merged into the third control via the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraRichEditRichEditControl_MailMergetopic1468"><u>RichEditControl.MailMerge Method</u></a> call. During this process, the <strong>CalculateDocumentVariable</strong> event is raised for the third control, because the master template (in the first control) contains a <strong>DOCVARIABLE</strong> field. Detail data rows from the second control are merged into a <strong>RichEditDocumentServer</strong> instance in this event handler. Finally, this instance is assigned to the <strong>e.Value</strong> parameter.</p><p>Both master and detail templates for this example are created by using <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E3661">Utility for creating a Mail Merge template</a>.</p><p>To test this example locally, setup the sample "Northwind" database in your SQL Server instance by using the instnwind.sql file, attached with this example.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress-Examples/master-detail-mail-merge-essential-the-simplest-implementation-e3662/11.1.9+/media/324c3a59-f99c-417d-8f46-f8090f827db6.png"></p><p><strong>See Also:<br />
